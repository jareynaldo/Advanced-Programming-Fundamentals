This GitHub repository features projects from my freshman year's combined Programming 1 and 2 course (COP3502-3). Initially focused on Python, the course quickly transitioned to C++ and advanced programming concepts, offering a dual-language foundation and a dive into more complex topics.

Initial Phase: Python basics for the first month.

Later Focus: Shift to C++, covering object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm optimization.

This condensed course provided a rigorous introduction to programming, equipping me with essential skills in Python and C++, and preparing me for advanced computational challenges.
